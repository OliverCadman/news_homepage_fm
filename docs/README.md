A pretty small-scale project; a home page for a fictional tech news website. Utilizes CSS technologies including Grid and Flexbox to achieve a layout that
breaks away from your average row/column humdrum.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Toggle the mobile menu (requires some JavaScript)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass - Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets](https://sass-lang.com/)

### What I learned

I learned a great deal about using CSS grid through developing this page. In particular, how the properties interact with eachother to structure the content (such as how what you define in `grid-template-columns` shapes how the `grid-column` property will behave, and similarly for `grid-template-rows` and `grid-row`).

### Continued development

I will continue to make this page responsive across more screen sizes. When using CSS grid in the future, I will think carefully about where to apply the high-level grid properties, as overlooking this during the development of the page meant that I had to re-organise some of my CSS code, which meant that some time was wasted. Always good to learn though!

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks- Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - CSS Tricks provides a great in-depth look into all of the grid's features and properties. It was an invaluable resource!
